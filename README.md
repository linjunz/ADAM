# ADAM

This code deals with the classification of high-dimensional Gaussian distributed data. The input training data can be either complete or incomplete. The procedure is based on the paper "Optimal Classification Error Analysis in High-dimensional Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis" by Cai and Zhang in 2017. It's fully data driven and adaptive. This code is implemented within MATLAB.
